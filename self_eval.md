# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Adding key-value pairs was a bit confusing at first, but I was able to master it through multiple exercises.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Note taking helps with modifiers more than anything. Sometimes these modifiers don't act like you would expect compared to how they are named.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I am getting better at recognizing when I can play around with tools I already have to solve a problem, versus when I know a concept does not fit into modifiers I have already learned. In the latter, I am comfortable searching for a solution on Google.
